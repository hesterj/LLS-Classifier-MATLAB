%This is the group project for COT 4501
%First we have to take the input data.  We will assume (for now)
%that the input files are in the correct format for libsvm, so we will use
%that format too. 

type input.txt; %reads input.txt from the desktop and prints to matlab
input = fopen('input.txt','r');  %open file for reading
colon = char(58);  %ascii for colon


%What we need at this point is a way to remove the tag index from the column.
% i/e right now all the leading 1s,2s, 3s, etc. in the columns preceding
% the colons need to be removed.  

[A,count] = fscanf(input, ['%f' colon])  %Read floats skipping colons
fclose(input);

%For some reason this only reads the first entry right now, it won't go to
%the second row or column.
